Passage Mercredi 28 a 15h

(a)Introduction
--> presentation of the problem, motivate the audience.
	
	Debian/Ubuntu mirror == permit to install multiple systems in your local network 
				because then all needed packages can be downlaoded over the lan connection, thus saving internet bandwidth.

	IT department use mainly Debian & Ubuntu distribution, a server mirror on our LAN network may save our bandwidth and help to manage the network.

(b)Method
--> approach and the caveats.
	
	At beginning, we wanted to use apt-mirror to setup the mirrors and supervise them with cacti/weathermap.
	During some months we encount some bugs, errors and dysfunctions with the plugins cacti & weathermap. 
	So we choose to use CentreonOS to supervise and monitor our setup. Easier, more ergonomic and more attractiv, it permit to show us graph, and real-time data
	on the servers.

	apt-mirror is a simple tools that setup an information system as a server mirror. Basically, I juse have to fill in some configuration file to say which
	version of Ubuntu or Debian i want to mirrored. Also i can explain when i want to update my mirror, see logs and all the salient informations.
	It is a tool that regroup all the basicals functions that we needed to build up our servers.

(c)Result
--> brief summary of your main result
	
	Today, our servers run properly, they are monitored and supervised by our CentreonOS. 
	at last, I have got a last errors on the server that makes association with client by command prompt impossible.
	It possible to download graphically some packet thanks to our web server on our server mirror [192.168.30.30 -- 192.168.30.91]

(d)Conclusion/Summary
--> condense your result and implications
	
	Thanks to this project we could express our skills and habilities acquired during 2 years at the IUT.
	Networks management, Network supervision, building up server, and Moniroting.
	Nowaday we can update our Debian/Ubuntu distribution only by using our server, it permits to save time and bandwidth. Also our configuration permit us to 
	regulate the connection to our server, and make him robust.
